# DiscordInjections

This script aims to pick up where [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) ends. Not only does it support custom CSS injections, but it also gives you the ability for custom JavaScript.

## Requirements

This module requires you to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed with ES6 support.

This module also requires [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

## Usage

All usage takes place in the folder you installed DiscordInjections into.

### Config

DiscordInjections has some configuration options. A default config.json file is generated when you run `npm run inject` (this will not overwrite existing files).

```js
{
    // This makes the background of the client transparent. On linux, you must run discord with the `--enable-transparent-visuals` flag!
    "transparent": false,
    // Set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable the OS frame around the client. Leave as `null` to use default client settings.
    "frame": null
}
```

### CSS

By default, DiscordInjections looks for a `style.css` file within the `CSS` folder. This file is not provided.

For a custom location, open the `General Settings` DiscordInjections settings tab in the user settings.

### JavaScript

There are two segments of JS that get injected.

#### Preload/index.js

This is content that gets injected before anything else in the discord client. It is what enables us to intercept the WS and localStorage objects. Put things that need to be loaded first here. Generally, this should not be modified.

#### Plugins

For extensibility, DiscordInjections uses a simple plugin system. Plugins are placed in the `Plugins/` directory.

To create a plugin, you must extend the `Structures/Plugin` class. See the `Plugins/SamplePlugin.js.EXAMPLE` file for an example.

For a list of plugins, visit [Plugins](https://github.com/DiscordInjections/Plugins)

##### WARNING

Plugins can be dangerous. Please read the disclaimer.

#### Note

Do not touch the `DomReady` directory, as it is what handles the custom CSS injections and plugins.

### WebSockets and localStorage

Discord deletes its websocket and localStorage references to prevent tampering. In order to prevent deletion, these variables are stored to `DI.ws` and `DI.localStorage` respectively.

Additionally, Discord initiates a new websocket object every reconnect. To ensure that your implementation works properly, you should define a `window.onWebsocketReload` function, that takes a websocket as an input.

## Disclaimer

DiscordInjections is not responsible for any plugins created by a third party. Needless to say, running plugins can be ***extremely dangerous*** as it exposes your entire discord client, as well as localStorage.

Before adding a plugin, be sure to thoroughly check its code to see what it does.

Stay safe.
